# Simple Object Recognition using Tensorflow JS

Inspired from https://hackernoon.com/tensorflow-js-real-time-object-detection-in-10-lines-of-code-baf15dfb95b2

We create a simple object recognition model using React and [TensorflowJS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js). We use the [Coco SSD](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd) model of **TensorflowJS** to make predictions
